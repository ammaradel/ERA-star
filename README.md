# ERA-star
Enhanced Relaxed A* algorithm for solving the shortest path problem in regular grid maps

## Use
``[map_with_path,path,D,iter,cost,fail,t] = Astar_anglesCases4(map,Nb_iter_max,i_start,j_start,i_goal,j_goal)``

map: a 2D matrix where obstacles have a value of 100

Nb_iter_max: Maximum number of iterations for finding the shortest path

i_start,j_start: Coordinates of the starting node

i_goal,j_goal: Coordinates of the goal node
